Tiny Game
================
A game that source code fits in a tweet (140 characters). Currently `tiny.html` is 139 characters but has plenty of room, as the `<!DOCTYPE html>` is not needed but it is an attempt to make it run smoother in browsers. (Currently only tested in Chrome)

## [Playing!](https://devincarr.github.io/tiny-game)
Once you load the page, there is a `<p>` tag that will start loading with either `*`, `@`, or `#` characters. Your job is to try and click on the list when a `*` is the last character. If you lose, an alert will notify you of `false`, and `true` if you win. After you close the alert, the tag will continue filling so keep on trying!
